#Features:-

1.The score and highscore are calculated differently . When the score hit "1" then only the highscore will show 50 and when the score hit "2" then it will show 40.

2.But there is a catch within the "score" code , it changes only when the clicked  button internally changes to 1 or 2. The outer button is just a view button where normal numbers will show but code will randomly produce the values on its own and all depends upon the fortune.

3.There also a "alert" function given which alerts you the time limit . When the time exceeds the "0" time, then a alert comes and the background becomes "Red" to make the limit more realistic.

NOTE:-This very beginner friendly JS bubble game project get the idea from  "Sheryians Coding School" and I tried to modify it little bit in my style to improve and implement the skills on this project.
